# Computer vision learning

## what we do here

I want to learn computer vision, so I will record my learning process here.
and I will try to write some code to implement the algorithm.
in other hand i want to help others who want to learn computer vision.

ok, let's start.

complete as soon as possible.

feel free to contact me if you have any question.
or you can create an issue to ask me.
**also you can create a pull request to help me improve this repo in other fields like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, etc.**
